              My name is Ã–zge and I'm currently living in Istanbul. I work as a
              frontend developer and I'm passionate about building engaging user
              interfaces. Currently, I'm focusing on building ReactJS and
              improving my skills with this popular JavaScript library. At work,
              I also use AngularJS and Java to develop web applications. I love
              learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and
              trends in the frontend development world, and I strive to improve
              myself every day.
